kqtl
====

This package provides a number of different QTL mapping utilities for multiparent populations, both for haplotype association and SNP association.

## Required non-CRAN R packages

The functions in this package generally expect that the haplotype data are stored in a genome cache, and make use of convenience utilities contained in bagpipe.backend, the R backend to the [Bagpipe](http://valdarlab.unc.edu/software/bagpipe/_build/html/index.html) software.
